Paul grew up in Vancouver, B.C., Canada. He left in 1989 and in 1993 completed a B.Sc. in Cognitive Science at Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario, where he was supervised by Dr. Kevin Munhall and Dr. Susan Lederman for his honours thesis project. After working for Dr. Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson during the summer at ATR in Japan, he joined the motor control lab at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, working with Dr. David Ostry. Paul's graduate work focused on computational models and empirical studies of multi-joint arm movements. In 1995 he received the M.Sc. and in 1999 a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology. He went on to do postdoctoral research in the Dept. of Anatomy and Cell Biology at Queen's University with Dr. Stephen Scott. In Dr. Scott's lab Paul worked on electrophysiological studies of neural representations of motor skills in non-human primates. In 2000 Paul accepted a position as Assistant Professor, jointly appointed in the Dept. Psychology and Dept. Physiology and Pharmacology at Western University in London, Ontario. In 2006 he was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure and in 2011 to Full Professor. As of July 1, 2024 Paul is the Director of the Graduate Program in Neuroscience.

Paul's research interests include the neural control of movement, motor learning, and computational models.

Paul teaches courses in Sensorimotor Control, Scientific Computing, Statistics, and Computational Neuroscience.
